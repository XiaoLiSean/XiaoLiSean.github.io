The Neural Network (NN), as a black-box function approximator, has been considered in many control applications. However, the difficulties in verifying the overall system safety, in the presence of uncertainties, hinder the deployment of NN in safety-critical systems. In this paper, we consider an NN-learned dynamic model that imitates an unknown real-world dynamical system and is subject to both bounded intrinsic and extrinsic uncertainties. We leverage the learned NN dynamic model to control the actual dynamical system. In this setting, we formulate the constrained reference tracking problem and show that it can be solved using Mixed-integer Linear Programming (MILP). The proposed MILP-based solution enjoys a provable safety guarantee, and these properties are also empirically demonstrated in navigating robots and avoiding obstacles in simulations.
