I'm a forthcoming Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor. My research interests include but not limited to learning, control and optimization. I'm specifically focusing on integrating modeling with data-driven methods to resolve robust and safety problems that emerged on the autonomous agents' applications.
