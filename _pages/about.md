I'm a Master's student in the ME department, University of Michigan. My research interests include but not limited to cognitive robotics, data-driven method, and optimal control. I'm specifically focusing on integrating mathematical and cognitive modeling with data-driven methods to resolve robust and safety problems that emerged on the autonomous agents' applications.
